    "## Azure SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure SDK is a set of official client libraries that simplify authenticating and working with Azure services from code, offering consistent APIs, Azure Identity-based auth, and service-specific clients for resources like AI, Storage, and Compute.​\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this script does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses DefaultAzureCredential so credentials can come from managed identity, environment variables, or developer login without hardcoding secrets.​​\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates an AIProjectClient from a connection string to point at a specific Azure AI/ML project and resource group for operations.​​\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates an AI agent with model gpt-4o-mini, a friendly name, and brief instructions to define behavior for responses.​\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates a conversation thread to hold messages and runs for stateful interactions with the agent.​\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adds a user message “Who is PM of India?” to the thread as the input the agent will process.​\n",
    "\n",
    "- Triggers create_and_process_run to execute the agent on the thread and checks the run status to detect success or failure.​\n",
    "\n",
    "- On failure, prints last_error so issues like rate limits can be diagnosed quickly and acted upon.​\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists thread messages, extracts the agent’s text reply, and prints it to stdout for visibility.​\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deletes the agent at the end to clean up and avoid leaving unused resources.​"
