1. Authenticate using Azure ClientSecretCredential 
   (Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret).

2. Connect to Azure AI Project using connection string.

3. Upload a CSV file (e.g., "sales_data.csv") 
   to be used by the AI agent for analysis.

4. Create a GPT-based AI agent with:
   - Model: gpt-4o-mini
   - Role: Perform data analysis and visualization
   - Tools: Code Interpreter linked to the uploaded file

5. Create a chat thread for interaction.

6. Start a loop where the user can send messages (like chat).

7. For each message:
   - Add it to the thread
   - Run the agent to process and respond
   - If run fails, show the error
   - Display the AI agent’s text response
   - If the response contains images (like charts), 
     download and save them locally.

8. End the loop when the user types “end”.

9. Delete the agent to free up resources.
